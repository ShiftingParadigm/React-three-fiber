# 🌌 React Three Fiber 3D Scene — ShiftingParadigm

This is a simple yet visually captivating 3D scene built using [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber), featuring a textured rotating cylinder with postprocessing effects like **Bloom**. It's my first project exploring 3D rendering in React, inspired by immersive web experiences.
